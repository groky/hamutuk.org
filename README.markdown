hamutuk: Timorese language (Tetun) - meaning: together

To develop the world, we must first invest in the development of it's people. If we do well, I hope others will follow.

Goal
To build a system whereby individuals can access funds to further their education. A project specification is being developed.

In brief: 
The website will accept donations from individuals and allocate those funds to individuals based on merit and needs of their respective communities. In some cases students will have to compete for scholarships, but we hope that doesn't have to happen too often!
